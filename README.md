# Server Monitoring Suite (In Development)

A distributed **Server Monitoring Suite** designed to track real-time system metrics across multiple nodes, built in **C++** for performance and reliability.  
The project is currently in active development, the **Agent** module is implemented and operational but has room for improvements, while the **Server** component is in progress.

---

## Overview

The Server Monitoring Suite aims to provide **lightweight, efficient, and real-time** monitoring of system resources such as:
- CPU & Memory utilization
- Disk usage and I/O stats
- Network throughput
- Process-level metrics

The architecture is designed around **a distributed model**, with:
- A **C++ Agent** running on each node to collect and transmit metrics.
- A **Central Server** to aggregate, store, and visualize data (in development).

---

## Current Progress

### Completed â€” Agent
- Written in modern **C++17**, focusing on speed and low resource footprint.
- Collects key system metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, etc.).
- Supports **cross-platform compatibility** (tested on Linux and Windows).
- Uses **socket-based communication** for sending data to the server.
- Modular code design for easy extension (additional metrics or sensors).
- Room for **improvements** and **hardening**.

### In Development â€” Server
- Backend planned to handle real-time data ingestion from agents.
- REST and WebSocket support for dashboard integration.
- Will include storage backend for historical metric analysis.
- Frontend (client) planned with **React + Tailwind** for a clean visualization UI.

---

## Highlights & Strengths

- **Efficient low-level data collection** using C++ system APIs.
- **Scalable architecture** allowing multiple agents per network.
- **Future-ready design**, planned integration with databases like InfluxDB or Prometheus.
- **Built from scratch**, demonstrating system-level understanding and distributed communication.
- **Easy to integrate** with existing monitoring stacks.

## Future Roadmap

| Stage | Component | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Agent | Fully developed and tested on multiple systems |
| Server | Implement API & metric aggregation engine |
| Visualization | Build a React/Tailwind dashboard for data display |
| Storage | Add persistent metric logging (e.g., SQLite/InfluxDB) |
| Intelligence | Introduce anomaly detection and alerting |
| Cloud Deploy | Dockerize and deploy across multiple instances |

---

## Scope for Improvement

- Add **encryption** and **authentication** for agent-server communication.
- Optimize **data batching and compression** for network efficiency.
- Integrate **prometheus-style exporters** for compatibility.
- Improve **dashboard interactivity** with live charts and filtering.
- Include **plug-in architecture** for custom metrics and extensions.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Agent | C++ |
| Server | C++ / REST API (in progress) |
| Frontend | React, Tailwind CSS (planned) |
| Communication | TCP/IP sockets |
| Data Handling | JSON / Protobuf (future) |

## Why This Project Matters

This suite is designed to be **fast, extensible, and educational**, suitable both as a real-world monitoring tool and a **learning project for distributed systems** and **systems programming** enthusiasts.  
It reflects hands-on experience in **C++ network programming, process monitoring, and low-level system interaction**.

---

## Current Status

- **Agent**: Completed and functional  
- **Server**: Under active development  
- **Dashboard**: Planned  

> The agent is ready to use and serves as the foundation for the rest of the suite.  
> Contributions, testing, and feedback are welcome!
